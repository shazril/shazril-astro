So far I only have made IT project proposals based on traditional way, like in Waterfall format.

It has the good old project management process flow. From requirement gathering, system design, system development, testing, deployment and finally training. We talk about the project costing in the end of the proposal.

This works for me so far. But I want to transition into Agile based proposal.

So far, I learnt that Agile based project management has better delivery promise and more transparency on project estimation.

Main problem is I don't know the flow of a successful Agile proposal, how it looks like and what to write in it.

If you happen to have one, I'd be happy to see sample proposal. You can send them to my email Shazril.shohaimi [at] Gmail.com.
