I have been a long time Wordpress user. I remember back in 2009 I used to make a photoblog using Wordpress. It was a cool project.

Now I have been doing Wordpress development professionally since 2019.

[As I mentioned before](https://shazril.com/posts/is-wordpress-still-relevant-in-2024/), Wordpress is my go to CMS for building customer's website. Main reason is because it is actively maintained, diverse ecosystem and beginner friendly.

Since professionally using Wordpress, I have been using few front end builders such as Elementor, Breakdance, and Bricks along the journey.

Here I share with you my experience of using those tools to improve my productivity.

## Elementor

Elementor was my first builder, and I still have been using it. It is very user friendly, and most wide adoption of front end builder that I have ever seen. The builder is pretty straight forward. Just drag and drop the element you want to use, adjust the settings and hit publish. WYSIWYG at it's finest.

Over the time, Elementor has been sloggish as it gets extended by third party extensions. Also, I don't really like the DOM count created by Elementor for a simple task. In layman term, more DOMs equals to more RAM it is needed to render the output.

So I started to explore other options.

## Breakdance

There was a huge hype for Breakdance and Bricks around September 2023. The time I decide to stop using Elementor as I struggled to optimize the page speed, plus some of third party extensions broke my client's website.

After few weeks of trial between the two, I decide to use Breakdance. It was an easy switch for me as the interface is really intuitive, if you're coming from Elementor especially. Performance wise, I was able to get my first 100% on page speed with Breakdance. Really happy with it.

For new clients, I will suggest to start development using Breakdance. If they have other idea, I will fall back to Elementor.

Current downside I can think of is the update is lagging. Last update from their website as of the blog's writing is November 23. That was almost 7 months since last update (almost May 24 now). I do hope the developer not to drop the project, as they did with Oxygen.

## Bricks

I'm still new with Bricks. Currently I am learning to use it. At first, I got very confused as there were not much resources available online. Now, I would say the builder is in good state. I figured out Bricks from some tutorials on Youtube.

Still learning it, so I can't recommend to my clients to switch to Bricks yet.

## Honorable mentions

Wordpress has introduced Gutenberg since they released version 6. I tried on my development, and have hard time understanding it. I will let the project be more mature before I decide to try it again.

My short exit from Elementor was actually Oxygen. I did try it and figured out how to use it. However I found some of the options are quite limited. Oxygen is really a good builder if you are ready to write custom code, as it can be extended in the builder itself. The developer decided they are done with Oxygen, and released Breakdance.
